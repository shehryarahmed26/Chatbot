# Custom Chatbot with JavaScript & Firebase

This project is a **JavaScript-based chatbot** designed with a custom if-else structure for handling user prompts. If a user's input doesn't match an existing condition, it is dynamically added to Firebase. The chatbot can be improved over time by reviewing and updating the conditions based on these stored prompts.

## Features
- **Custom If-Else Logic**: Designed to handle user input with predefined conditions.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Unmatched prompts are stored in Firebase for future logic updates.
- **Firebase Integration**: Real-time storage of user inputs and prompt history.
- **Scalability**: Easily expandable by reviewing stored prompts and updating the logic.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: Firebase (for real-time database)
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
